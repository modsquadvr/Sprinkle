          <h2>Author’s Guide for <span
>VicStories</span></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ink language is very flexible, and you should feel free
to use anything in it you like. There is a short authoring guide at <a
href="https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/">https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/</a>
and a much more complete one at <a
href="https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md">https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md</a></p>

<p>There will eventually be a nice editor on this page and you won't have to go anywhere else to author a story. We're not quite there, yet, though. In the meantime I would suggest downloading the Inky authoring tool from here: <a href="https://github.com/inkle/inky">https://github.com/inkle/inky</a> and then emailing in your stories to be added to the website. We'll get the kinks worked out and then make it easier.</p>

<p>In order to fit within the confines of our application,
though, we will need to define some standardized behaviour, <span>and
also</span> some rules for how to add images, etc.</p>

<p>The first standards are some set variables. The most
important being location. We will have to have a set list of locations by the
time we ship, and there will be a little bit of work to add new locations. Locations
will be found in a global variable named “Place” which will take a string.
Please send mail to <a href="mailto:vicstories@lists.uvic.ca">vicstories@lists.uvic.ca</a> to have any places added.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the following:</p>

<p>“<span>cityhall</span>” city hall</p>

<p>“interactivity” Interactivity board games café</p>

<p>“<span>victheater</span>” the Vic theater</p>

<p>“cineplex” the Cineplex Odeon</p>

<p>“capitol6” the capitol 6</p>

<p>“<span>VFFoffice</span>” the VFF office</p>

<p>We will certainly add some additional locations, but this
set will allow the testing of stories within a close area to make initial
authoring easier.</p>

<p>The next variables are to do with some general preferences.
We want users to be able to decide how to interact with the stories globally
rather than for each story. Most of these will not apply to people playing on
the website since we are limited in what we can do there.</p>

<p>“Notify” has the options “never”, “app open”, and “always”
which determines whether the user wants a notification when new story content
becomes available. For instance, if story content triggers on proximity to city
hall, will just walking pass cause an alert? Or will you need to have the app
in the foreground to see that something has happened.</p>

<p>“Location” has the options “auto” and “manual”. This is to
allow players on mobile devices to set their location via a checkbox if they
want to play the whole game from one location. This is a variable because as a
story author you are welcome to hide things that are ONLY visible from a place,
but in general you should make everything available to lazy players.</p>

<p>“Sound” has the options “sound” and “silent”. It is not
clear how much use of sound stories will provide, but this is to allow for the
option.</p>

<p>Each image or sound in a story will have to be uploaded with
the story. In order to make organization of this easier, there will be a form
on the author page asking for several pieces of information. The first is the
story name, this should be a one-word unique name to identify the story. This
will not be shown to players. For instance, if I am writing a story about a dog
and a <span>boy</span> I might choose <span>dogandboy</span>
as my unique name. This name is to be used for all submission for this story.
The mandatory pieces are a text file that contains the summary information for
the story:</p>

<p>Title – the full title of the story, as seen by the user</p>

<p>Summary – a short summary of the story. Something to get the
viewer hooked.</p>

<p>Movie – the movie that inspired the story (NB this field
will be hidden on the website until after the Jan.18 movie announcements)</p>

<p>Author – the name (or names) of the author of the story</p>

<p>The story itself will be in an “ink” file. This is a text
file that contains the source for the story.</p>

<p>The story must also be delivered in a compiled form as a
json file.</p>

<p>Finally, any images or sound files should be numbered
sequentially – dogandboy1.jpg, dogandboy2.jpg, dogandboy1.mp3, etc.</p>

<p>When the authoring portion of the webpage is finished there
will be a form for the summary, and editor for the story, and an upload for the
images and sounds that will make these naming decisions automatic.</p>
